# 💫 About Me

Hi there, I'm **SeungHyeon Lee** 👋

I'm a passionate **Cloud Platform & Backend Engineer** at **Naver Cloud**, with a strong background in developing scalable and resilient cloud services from the ground up.

A unique aspect of my career is my transition from a **Mechanical Engineer** within Naver's data centers to a **Software Engineer**. This journey has given me a deep, full-stack understanding of cloud infrastructure—from the physical layer to the software services running on top. I am driven by a passion for building reliable products that solve real-world problems.
